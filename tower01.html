     The horizon evaporates perverted, destroyed, blind &amp; with its loss each burned page disappears.

   </p>

   <p>

     Already open to stagnation, this sick lies like a black canvas, tied to the black spirit, tormenting.

   </p>

   <p>

     The future are pale words, swallowed by ideas &amp; a message that should never have been.

   </p>

   <p>

     Smoke clings to each daily line, without escape. The symbols dissipate like neurons that fade with each joint.
